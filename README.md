# Git Progress Sync

Syncs your changed files in your git repo to your self hosted server to easily continue where you left off.

Most useful for switching between computers whenever you want.

For now, saves to a local file, that could be OneDrive using rclone.

## Installation

```bash
cargo install --path .
```
